----------------------------------To Create  Component 

1- by simple function that's for training in App.js create Test function then in function app put <Test />
2- by class that's with default when you install react-create-app you will find class in old versions of react
3- react hooks is used instead class and that give the function a lot of features
4- create components folder inside the src folder
 then you can move the Test function to it with component file Test.js then import it in App.js and use it
don't forget to this line in the component file export default ComponentName (Test)
5- the same thing as above for class (but creating class is defferent in syntax see Hello.js)
6- delete component which are not used may be make errors
